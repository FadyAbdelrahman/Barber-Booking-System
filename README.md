## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that modernises the appointment booking process for barbershops. Built under the **"Sharp Society"** brand, the system replaces traditional phone-based scheduling with a smooth, responsive digital experience — allowing customers to browse services, choose a barber, and confirm a time slot in under a minute.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ Full-stack application with React 18 frontend + Node.js/Express backend
- ✅ MySQL relational database with 4 normalised tables and foreign key constraints
- ✅ JWT authentication system with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ 15+ RESTful API endpoints with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Admin panel for managing barbers, services, and appointments
- ✅ Fully responsive UI across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ✅ End-to-end tested with Postman
